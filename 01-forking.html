<p>Now, we will see how GitHub can be used as a powerful collaboration tool. To begin, we need to navigate to the countries repository the instructor created during the set up for this lesson. In the search box on the top, search for the name of the repository.</p>
<p>GitHub allows users to search on different levels. If you are already it in a repository, it will automatically search within that repo. As an indicator, “this repository” will appear in the search bar. Since we want to search all GitHub repositories, click the GitHub icon to reset the search settings.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/01-fig_02.png" alt="Searching within a specific repo" />
<p class="caption">Searching within a specific repo</p>
</div>
<p>Once we have located the repository, clicking the title will take us to the repo. There is one folder and a README.md file within the directory. We can explore the files within the GitHub interface. Click on countries and then any of the markdown(.md) files.</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2 id="readme.md"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>README.md</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Remember that it is best practice to always have a README.md file within your repository. It should be descriptive so others (or you in a few months) will understand the purpose/structure of your code.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Each of these files contains spaces for information about the population, capital, offical language, and interesting trivia for a specific country. Our goal today is to update a few of the files with information about the designated country.</p>
<p>Unlike our earlier experience GitHub, we do not own this repository. We can quickly identify the owner by looking at the repostiory name located directly beneath the search bar. The first part of the name is the GitHub user who owns the repository followed by a slash and the repository’s name. The owner could be an individual or organizaiton.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/01-fig_03.png" alt="The owner of this repo is oulib-swc" />
<p class="caption">The owner of this repo is oulib-swc</p>
</div>
<p>Since we do not own this project, we don’t want to make changes directly to this code. Instead, we should make a copy of the code, make our changes, and submit it to the owner. If the owner likes our changes, she can then incorporate it into the original repo.</p>
<p>In GitHub, making a copy of a repository is called forking. In the top right corner of the page, under your profile picture, there are three buttons. Click on Fork to create a forked copy of the repo. The number beside Fork indicates the number of times the original repo has been forked.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/01-fig_04.png" alt="Fork the Repo" />
<p class="caption">Fork the Repo</p>
</div>
<p>After you fork the repo, GitHub will automatically redirect you to your forked verison. The forked repository is identical to the original repo. The forked verison includes all of the commits and contributors as the original.</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2 id="selecting-where-to-fork"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Selecting where to fork</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>If you are a member of organizations on GitHub, you will need to select where you want to fork the repository. For this exercise, please select your personal GitHub account.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>If we look at the title, we can see that the owner has changed. Now, our account name is listed before the name of the repository. There is also a link to the original repo.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The Forked Repo</p>
</div>
<p>Now that we have our own copy, we are ready to start adding information.</p>
